\chapter{Results}

This chapter presents the results of the project in a structured way to evaluate whether a proof of concept has been successfully achieved and to explore the applicability of modern \gls{dl} architectures for testing \gls{db} \gls{sw}. The chapter is divided into two main sections, each corresponding to a key phase of the project.

The first section discusses the results from the model training process. This includes an overview of the generated output graphs and a discussion of the model performance in terms of accuracy, loss, and generalization capabilities.

The second section focuses on the results obtained from integrating the complete system. It covers how the \gls{hil} was used to change the \gls{db} views, trigger the Flask application and execute the image analysis process. The final detection results are reviewed and used to assess the system overall functionality and reliability.
